        <p class="para-one">The second of six siblings, 
            my name is Ray Brandon Gemino Bayno, and I was born 
            on Olango Island in Lapu-Lapu City on March 24, 2023.
             Sherlita Ursal Gemino and Ray Apollo Tutor Bayno were my 
             parents. In 2009, when he was 39 years old, my father suffered 
             a heart attack that was most likely brought on by a lifetime of 
             drinking. Fortunately, I've been wise enough to stay away from 
             that awful behavior. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-one"> 
            In the early 2000s, I grew up in a normal lower-class setting.
             From the time I was born until I turned three, my family used
              to reside on the island with my grandparents. My mother was a
               stay-at-home mom, while my father operated sound systems for
                a living. Back then, I had a contented childhood. Later, when
                 my father developed tuberculosis, we moved to the city's
                  mainland for easier access to medical facilities. When he
                   felt healthy enough, he accepted a position as a traffic
                    cop in Lapu-Lapu.
        </p>
        <p class="para-one">
            As our daily necessities could not be met by my father's pay,
             difficulties began to emerge. Nearly daily, we always ate noodles.
              There are days when we skip meals because there is nothing on the 
              table. We wait for our father in the hopes that he would have a gift
               for us. Until he fell ill once more, and this time we lost him. My
                mom was stunned. She already questions her capacity to raise all 
                of us alone. We were transferred back to the island, where with 
                the help of our grandparents, we continued our education.
        </p>
        <p class="para-one">
            To provide for us, my mother looked for employment. But the fact 
            that she couldn't have a secondary diploma made her search even 
            more difficult. She made a brave leap of faith by opting to work
             in Bulacan, not knowing what would be in store for her. She sold
              furniture because it was commission-based when she became needy.
               There will be no food if nothing is sold. She frequently sobbed
                and looked for work as a housemaid. She prayed, and God heard
                 her, allowing her to meet a good and sympathetic policeman.
                  The man feels sorry for her since he knows about us and the
                   path she has taken. The employer made the decision to pay 
                   her fare and provide her an allowance so she could return home.
        </p>
        <p class="para-two">
            When my mother arrived home, we were delighted. However, as my father's 
            favorite child, I often experience the isolation of having no one to
             lean on when I fall. I gave it my all, and when I finished from primary 
                school, I received the highest honor. However, I developed a computer
                 gaming addiction during my high school years, which caused me to drop
                  out of classes. With the help of my grandfather, my mother was able
                   to replace my father's employment as a traffic enforcer. She 
                   discovered a new love in a man she believed might improve our
                    life. She drove me back to the city and enrolled me in a night 
                    high school, but I failed her since I was once again preoccupied with
                     video games. She put all of her faith in our oldest, sending her 
                     to college in the hopes that she would one day be able to give her
                      younger siblings a better life.
        </p>
        <p class="para-two">
            My playmate once requested that I sign up for the city's Alternative
             Learning System. When my mother found out, she brought me to the center
              to sign me up. I registered and met my girlfriend, who pushes me to 
              succeed in my academic endeavors. We graduated together in 2015, and 
              she provided me with emotional support.
        </p>
        <p class="para-two">
            After I graduated, I tried to ask my mother if she would be willing to
             pay for my college tuition, but she was more concerned about paying for 
             my sister's education. She then permitted me to work at a water station.
              I feel invisible, which makes life emotionally more difficult. It's
               fortunate for me that I never lost my network of support, which included
                my partner. In the year 2020, my girlfriend moved in with me as a 
                warehouseman after landing a job in Mandaue City. Working hard and 
                knowing the procedure cleared the door for our department's management
                 to trust me with challenging duties that site engineers would typically
                  handle. Yes, I did learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p class="para-two">
            Just last year, my girlfriend pushed me to go after my dream of going to
             college in order to better my family's life. After that, I left the business
              and enrolled in Lapu-Lapu City College. I'm currently enrolled in a 
              Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology program with a computer 
              technology concentration. Looking forward to a fruitful years ahead.
